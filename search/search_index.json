Setting up the prefix I want the bot to respond when I use the prefix - to do that, I can type !prefix set - . Carlbot offers up to 15 prefixes at once, so I could also add a second prefix by typing !prefix add . 2. Setting up all the channels !log channel <#channel> Sets the channel where carlbot will log things such as message deletions, name changes, role updates. More on that later. !set welcome <#channel> Decides where join/leave/ban messages go, more on that later. 3. Setting up reaction roles Reaction roles work best in their own channels, so carlbot offers a command to create a channel specifically for reaction roles with some permissions that most people will find useful. We can create this channel by typing !rr channel It's recommended that you use !rr make for this if you are new. 4. Setting up modlogs Since we're doing this from a clean slate, I will use !modlogs create to create a channel with the appropriate permissions. If we already had a channel where moderation actions were sent, we could have used !modlogs set <#channel> 5. Setting up starboard !starboard will create the starboard !star limit <count> will change the required number of stars for a post to show up in the starboard. 6. Configuring logs By default, the log will log everything every member does in every channel, this isn't always what we want. Let's say we don't care about message edits, the way we stop those from showing up in the log is by typing !log edit . The !log command takes an event as its argument and tries to figure out what you want toggled. Another thing we can do is ignore messages deleted in certain channels. Maybe we don't care about messages deleted in mod channels. !log ignore #illuminati is how we'd ignore events from the channel #illuminati. Read the full page for more info, it's very customizable. 7. Setting up a mute role By typing !muterole create we can create a role with the permission \"send messages\" denied in every channel. Please note that any future channels created will not be covered by the bot. Users can now mute with the !mute <@member> [time] [reason] command 8. Adding twitch streamers No point setting up a twitch channel if you don't have any streamers to track. I enjoy watching b0aty, so I'll add him by typing !twitch b0aty . Now any time b0aty comes online I will be notified. 9. Setting up join messages First we will set the message sent to the previously set channel with: !welcome Hello there {user}, glad to have you in the tutorial server We can also set a different message to be sent directly to the member upon joining by typing: !joindm Hello and welcome to the tutorial server, please read #rules and respect the other members This is far from everything carlbot has to offer, but at this point you will have set up most of the things that you can set up.","title":"Basic bot setup"},{"location":"basic-bot-setup/#basic-bot-setup","text":"Info This is much easier done on the website at https://carl.gg This guide will cover everything you need to do to get started with everything carlbot offers.","title":"Basic bot setup"},{"location":"basic-bot-setup/#1-setting-up-the-prefix","text":"I want the bot to respond when I use the prefix - to do that, I can type !prefix set - .

Most people are probably best off using !rr make simply because it guides you through the process and tries to tell you what went wrong if any. Other ways of doing it includes using !rr aio which results in the same result as !rr make but with just a single command, it uses some weird syntax if you are unfamiliar, so I would recommend sticking to !rr make until you are familiar with the bot. Here is a screenshot of me setting up unique reaction roles for my bot help server What's the drama channel? It's a premium feature that aims to streamline your server's moderation. Automod is nice, but it's not perfect, false positives happen. The drama channel was made for that exact reason. You need to: Set up the drama channel. Either on the dashboard or with the command !am drama <channel> Set the automod punishment to 'Post to drama channel (premium only)' on the dashboard Why does the bot complain about requiring more permissions? I've given it manage roles already! The way discord decides if you can add a role or not is based on two things: Does the member adding the role have 'manage roles' Is the member trying to add the role higher in the role hierarchy than the role they're trying to add? Just assign the bot a role that is higher than highest role it has to assign, the role being hoisted does not have to have any special permissions. How do I get a message ID? Discord settings -> Appearance -> Developer mode For reaction roles already set up you can also use !rr show How do I get the bot to announce new members joining? Use the dashboard! https://carl.gg Just make sure to set a welcome channel in the top left box. You find the settings under 'welcome'. I don't want normal users creating tags, but I obviously can't disable tag, what do I do? !tag modonly will make it so that only mods can manage tags, while anyone can still use them I set up a highlight word but it's not working Yes it is. The bot tries to detect when you're reading the chat and not spam you with unnecessary pings. If you wish to see if a message would have triggered any of your words, use !hl match <sentence> Another bot has the same command and they both respond, what do I do? Depends on what you're after. If you need to use both, you're pretty much forced to change the prefix of either bot. If you're after just the non-carlbot command, you can disable it with !disable <command> . If you just want carlbot's command, I suppose you could create an alias using tags and {cmd:cmdname {args}} see the \"Advanced tag usage\" section for more information.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#how-do-i-create-reaction-roles","text":"Most people are probably best off using !rr make simply because it guides you through the process and tries to tell you what went wrong if any.

The warn threshold determines how Carl-bot reacts when a user receives a new warning and their new total number of warnings exceeds a set limit. Unless a user's warnings are reset or reduced manually, this punishment will trigger each time a user receives a new warning while their total number of warnings is above your server's set limit.

They are easy to use and can be very powerful. With some ingenuity, you can create your own. It is for instance entirely possible to create an 8ball command, a hug command and many other things using just tags. To do more than just output plaintext, you must configure the command's behavior using what is called Tagscript. Tagscript is a small language the bot interprets, made up of dynamic \"blocks\". To build a tag you will need to combine various blocks to tell the tag what you want it to do. Some parts of Tagscript can be used elsewhere within Carl-bot, like in Triggers, Autofeeds, and Welcome/Leave/Ban Messages. Limits Tags must be under 25000 characters long in the \"Content\" section. Tags CANNOT and will NEVER be able to DM a mentioned user, only the tag's invoker. A tag's output is sent as one message that can consist of 2000 characters of plaintext, and an embed attached to that message. Command blocks can be used for additional output. Embeds attached to Tags via the Dashboard are subject to the same limits detailed in the Embeds section. Tip If you would like a Tag that outputs sections of this documentation on demand ( like the help command ), visit this link and import the tse tag to your server: https://carl.gg/t/204246 Anatomy of a Tagscript Block All Tagscript blocks begin with a left curly brace { , and end with a right curly brace } . Immediately after the left curly brace is the block name , which determines the behavior of the block. Some blocks have aliases or multiple names that produce the same behavior. Depending on the block name and desired behavior, there might be parameters following the block name. These are put inside parentheses: (parameters) If the block performs an action upon a variable or string, that object, called the payload , must follow the parameters or block name. The payload is separated from the rest of the block by a colon. : Anatomy of a Tagscript Block {blockname(parameters):payload} Now to get to the blocks themselves. Tagscript blocks are split into rough categories based on their behavior or characteristics. Default Variables Tagscript comes with a few default variables. They are: Default Variables {unix} Current Unix time, useful for math blocks. This only works in Tags. {uses} The number of times the tag has been used. This only works in Tags. {mention} Mentions the user of the tag {args} {message} The arguments (words used) after the tag invocation. !foo bar baz means {args} ==bar baz For triggers {args} contains the entire message. Two especially notable default variables are {args} and {message} . {args} vs {message} Both {args} and {message} represent the same thing, but they act as separate variables. If args or message are accidentally used as a variable name, the other will continue to represent the arguments during the tag execution. However , the digit shorthand variables {1} , {2} , {3} , etc, are based upon {message} , not {args} , meaning if message is used as a variable name those shorthand variables will represent the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc index values in the new {message} variable rather than the arguments they represented prior. Discord Objects The following Discord Objects are also default variables that are defined upon tag use: Discord Objects {user} Nickname of the user that used the tag {target} Similar to {user} , if the tag user mentions someone after the invocation, this variable is the mentioned user's nickname. If nobody is not mentioned, {target} == {user} . {server} The name of the server {channel} The name of the channel the tag was used in Discord Object Properties Discord Object blocks contain certain properties. To access a Discord Object block's property, you specify the property name as the block's parameter, like {user(id)} , or {server(owner)} . Discord Object Properties {user} & {target} (avatar): a link to the user's avatar (icon): the same as (avatar) (id): the user's Discord ID, a multi-digit number that is unique to that user. (mention): a string to mention the user. (created_at): outputs the date the account was created in the format yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS (joined_at): outputs the date the account joined the server in the format yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS (color): the hexadecimal color code relating to the user's highest non-default role color (preceding '#' included). (name): their Discord account username, not their nickname. (proper): their username followed by their discriminator. username#0001 (roleids): a list of the role IDs for every role the user has, listed from lowest in the hierarchy to highest (position): their position in the role hierarchy. Position starts with 0 for @everyone at the bottom and increases by 1 for each role in the server going upwards. {server} (icon): a link to the Server's icon (id): the Server's ID (owner): username#discrim format of the server owner (random): username#discrim format of a random member of the server (randomonline): username#discrim format of a random member who is online (randomoffline): username#discrim format of a random member who is offline (members): number of members in the server (bots): number of bots in the server (humans): number of humans in the server (roles): number of roles in the server (channels): number of channels in the server (created_at): when the server was created in the format yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS {channel} (id): the channel's id (topic): the channel's topic (slowmode): the current slowmode delay (position): the channel's position. This is the order in which the channels were created, 0 being the first channel in the server. (mention): clickable link to the channel Meta Blocks Meta blocks change the tag's overall behavior. Where the output is sent, if the invocation is deleted, if any commands blocks used in the tag should output their standard output in addition to the tag's output, who can and can't use the tag, if the bot should react to the invocation or the output, etc. Action Blocks Action blocks change how the invocation, tag output, and command blocks contained within the tag act. Action Blocks Delete {delete} {del} Deletes the message or invocation that triggered the tag. Silence {silence} {silent} Silences the usual output of any command being used in a command block. Override {override} This instructs the tag to act as if the tag user has the modrole. Carl-bot still respects role hierarchy though. For a tag creator to add this they must have Manage Server permissions or the modrole. Redirection Blocks Redirects the output of the tag and any command blocks unless otherwise specified in the command. You can only specify one tag output destination, if multiple are provided the latter will override the former. Redirection Blocks DM {dm} Redirects output as a direct message to the tag user . Tags cannot be used to direct message mentioned users. Channel {redirect:channel} Redirects output to the specified channel. The tag's creator needs to have send message permissions in the pointed channel. The \"channel\" must either be valid a channel name, a channel id, or a mention formatted channel id like <#556675168634798111> . Example - Redirection Blocks {user} says: {args} {redirect:screaming-out-loud} {redirect:186980582863929345} Use Limiting Blocks These blocks limit tag usage to users with or without roles, to only certain channels, or excludes usage in specific channels. Use Limiting Blocks Require {require(message):channel,role} Limits the tag to executing ONLY when the user has a role listed or when used in a channel listed. Blacklist {blacklist(message):channel,role} Prevents the tag from executing when the user has a role listed or when used in a channel listed. The message in the parameters is optional. It will display instead of the warning emoji if the require block or blacklist block prevent the user from using the tag. Both accept roles and channels. Entries must be separated by a comma. They must either be a role/channel name, a role/channel id, or a mention formatted role/channel id like <@&554342061428572170> or <#556675168634798111> . Examples - Require & Blacklist Require {require(you're not cool enough):Cool kids} Word around the office is that {user} is kind of a big deal Blacklist {blacklist:Staff} You have no power here Channel and Role Names Be cautious of using channel and role names in restrict, require, and blacklist blocks. If the channel or role name is changed, the tag must be changed or it will not function as intended. Using IDs makes this a non-issue as channel and role IDs cannot change. React Blocks React Blocks instruct Carl-bot to react to either the invocation or the output. Carl-bot, like all Discord accounts, must be in the server where the emoji is hosted to be able to use it. If the emoji is from a server he is in but not the server the tag is in, the emoji ID may need to be used instead of just the name. <:carlpat:590335691968348191> Premium Restriction React Blocks are limited to using one emoji, but this restriction is lifted for premium servers in which react blocks can use 5 emojis. React Blocks {react: :laughing: :fortnight:} Reacts with the emoji(s) listed to the tag's output message. Cannot react to command block output messages. {reactu: :laughing: :fortnight:} Reacts (upwards) with the emoji(s) listed to the tag's invocation or to the message containing the trigger word. Use a space to separate multiple emoji. Command Blocks Command blocks execute a Carl-bot command. The formatting and syntax do not change compared to how Carl-bot commands are normally used, except you do not include a prefix. Command blocks cannot use reaction role commands, nor can they call other tags or use tag commands. If the tag's user does not have the permissions required to use the command, Carl-bot will not use it and will output an error message as if they had tried to use the command. Command blocks can only be used in Tags. Command Block Aliases {command:pick Pizza,Burgers,Takeout} {cmd:echo {args}} {c:role add {user(id)} Verified} Executes the Carl-bot command in the payload. Block names are synonymous. Premium Restriction Tags are limited to using one command block per tag unless the server is marked as premium. Tags in Carl-bot premium servers can use three command blocks per tag. Override The action block {override} can be a useful tool in allowing users to use a specific command in a command block that they would not otherwise have permission to use. Command blocks can also be used to rename a command or create an alias for it. Using Tags to Create Command Aliases !tag + whois {cmd:info {args}} !tag + iam {cmd:rank {args}} !tag + lb {c:leaderboard {args}} Control Blocks Control blocks control the flow of your tag and determine what payloads are passed to the rest of the tag or block. They are conditional statements that evaluate boolean equations you provide as block parameters. Booleans A boolean is a binary variable, having two possible values called true and false . Boolean equations compare an entity on the left of an operator to an entity to the right of the operator, and depending on the comparison the operator requires, it evaluates to either true or false. Boolean Operators in Tagscript Equal == Evaluates to true if the string on the left is identical to the string on the right. Not Equal != Evaluates to true if the string on the left is not identical to the string on the right. Greater Than > and >= Evaluates to true if the number on the left side is greater than the number on the right. >= is greater than or equal. Less Than < and <= Evaluates to true if the number on the left side is less than the number on the right. <= is less than or equal. Examples - Boolean Equations Equal cat==dog This would evaluate to false. 5==5 This would evaluate to true. Not Equal tree!=car This would evaluate to true. 10!=10 This would evaluate to false. Greater Than 15>20 This would evaluate to false. 17>=17 This would evaluate to true. Less Than 1<=1 This would evaluate to true. 25<5 This would evaluate to false. If the boolean equation in the block's parameters evaluates as true, the control block will continue executing the payload. If the boolean equation evaluates as false, the control block will execute the second portion of the payload starting after the | character, if present, otherwise the tag will act as if the control block does not exist. Control Blocks If {if(booleanEQ):then|else} If the boolean equation evaluates to true, the block will result in the payload. If the boolean equation evaluates to false, the block will result in the second portion of the payload after the | if provided. Any/Or {any(booleanEQ1|booleanEQ2|etc):then|else} {or(booleanEQ1|booleanEQ2|etc):then|else} If any of the boolean equations provided evaluate to true, the block will result in the payload. If all of the boolean equations evaluate to false, the block will result in the second portion of the payload after the | if provided. Separate boolean equations inside the parameters with a pipe character | . All/And {all(booleanEQ1|booleanEQ2|etc):then|else} {and(booleanEQ1|booleanEQ2|etc):then|else} If all of the boolean equations provided evaluate to true, the block will result in the payload. If any of the boolean equations evaluate to false, the block will result in the second portion of the payload after the | if provided. Separate boolean equations inside the parameters with a pipe character | . Break/Shortcircuit {shortcircuit(booleanEQ):then} {short(booleanEQ):then} {break(booleanEQ):then} If the boolean equation evaluates to true, the tag's output will ONLY be the payload of this block. However, Carl-bot commands in command blocks will still execute, and if an embed is defined in the tag's attached embed builder it will still send. Else Statements For the if , any , and all control blocks, an optional else statement can be added after the payload by using a pipe character | . If the boolean equation is true the payload is what is between the colon : and the pipe | . If the boolean equation is false, the payload is what is between the pipe | and the end of the block } . If the control block does not have an else statement and the boolean is false, the Tagscript Engine ignores that control block. Examples - Control Blocks If {if({user(id)}=={target(id)}):You didn't mention someone else.|{user} says {target} is a wuss!} Any/Or {any({user(color)}==#5989ab|{user(color)}==#6296ff|{user(color)}==#000001):You're awesome} All/And {all({1}>0|{1}<=100):You ate {args} tacos.|You must input a number between 1 and 100} Break/Shortcircuit {break({1}==):You did not provide the proper input.} Data Storage & Parsing Tags cannot save data between invocations. There is no database you can read from or write to. But tags can still store data and values to variables and reference them within the instance of the tag. Variable Assignment Blocks Often in a tag, you might want to reference the same string of words, or the same number multiple times in your tag. Assigning variables is how you would assign a value to a name for reuse across your entire tag. Variable Assignment Block Aliases {=(variablename):Content} {assign(variablename):Content} {let(variablename):Content} {var(variablename):Content} Assigns the content in the payload to the name given in the parameters. Block names are synonymous. Variable Naming You can name variables whatever you would like, but if they share the name of any other Tagscript block or block alias, they will not work to reference the payload. A common error is to name a variable {=(c):content} {c:} is an alias for the command block. It is recommended that variable names be at least 2 characters long. Variable Blocks To call the variable, or use the value stored in variablename , you reference the variable's name as a block: {variablename} Example - Nested Variables {=(msg1):Hello World} {=(msg2):How are you today?} {=(msg3):See you later!} You could reference any of the messages in those variables by following the tag invocation with a number from 1 to 3, and nesting {1} inside the {msg} variable call at the end. {msg{1}} With a variable block, you can reference individual words in the variable, like parsing through a list, by specifying the index, or number, for that element as a parameter. The elements in a list are indexed according to their sequence. Index values for variables start at 1 and increment with each delimiter encountered. A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters for specifying the boundary between separate, independent strings. The default delimiter for variables in Tagscript is a space. You can also set a custom delimiter for a variable block by specifying it as the variable block's payload. Example - Variable Parsing {args} is the most common variable used in tags, because it is how a tag's creator accesses the information included with the tag's invocation. In this example, {args} is: Carl likes Subway. Today he got a Spicy Italian with - double pepperoni, double salami, provolone, and tomatoes. Basic Parsing Since space is the default delimiter, you can easily grab individual words {args(1)}==Carl , {args(2)}==likes , and {args(3)}==Subway. You can also use {1} to mean {args(1)} , {2} to mean {args(2)} etc... You can parse backwards by using index values below 1. {args(0)}==tomatoes. , {args(-1)}==and , {args(-2)}==provolone, Use a + before the index to reference every element up to and including the index value. {args(+9)}==Carl likes Subway. Today he got a Spicy Italian Use a + after the index to reference the index value and every element after it. {args(-11+)}==a Spicy Italian with - double pepperoni, double salami, provolone, and tomatoes. Defining Delimiters You can grab the sentences separately by defining the delimiter as a . {args(2):.}==Today he got a Spicy Italian with - double pepperoni, double salami, provolone, and tomatoes What if you wanted to parse through just the toppings? Set the toppings to another variable then parse that. {=(toppings):{args(2):-}} {toppings(1):,}== double pepperoni , {toppings(2):,}== double salami , {toppings(0):,}== and tomatoes. If you attempt to reference an element with an index that is out of bounds for the variable, Tagscript will return the whole variable. {args(19)}==Carl likes Subway. Today he got a Spicy Italian with - double pepperoni, double salami, provolone, and tomatoes. If you attempt to reference a span of elements using + after an index that is out of bounds for the variable, Tagscript will return nothing. {args(3+):.}== List & Cycle Blocks List and Cycle Blocks are another way to parse through a list of values in Tagscript. They both strictly use either commas , or tildes ~ as the delimiters for the list placed in the block's payload. Use tildes when elements contains commas. These blocks only functions in Tags. List & Cycle Blocks List {list(index):elem,elem2...} Returns the element in the payload the corresponds to the index value in the parameters. Block is null if the index is out of bounds. Cycle {cycle(index):elem,elem2...} Returns the element in the payload the corresponds to the index value in the parameters. Loops around if the index is out of bounds. Both lists and cycles use 0 as the index for the first element in the list. List blocks will return null if the index is out of bounds, which can be useful. Cycle blocks will loop if the index is greater than the number of elements in the list (essentially index = index % list_length). Both allow for backward parsing using negative values. Both blocks will return an error message if the value in parameters is not a number. Example - List & Cycle Blocks List {list(3):Apples~Bananas~Pears~Grapes~Oranges} == Grapes Cycle {cycle(11):Apples,Bananas,Pears,Grapes,Oranges} == Bananas Index Blocks The index block functions inversely compared to other data parsing blocks. Instead of using an index value to return an element from a list or string, it finds the specified element in the payload and returns that element's index value. This block only functions in Tags. Index Blocks {index(element):list of elements} Returns the index value of the element in the parameters for the content in the payload. The index block uses 0 as the index for the first element in the payload. The index block always views the payload as being delimited by spaces. If the element specified in the parameters is not found in the payload, the index block will return -1 . The index block will always return the index for the first instance of the element in the payload, regardless of how many times it is present. Example - Index Blocks {index(bread):Which do you like more, bread or chocolate? I like bread more} == 5 Membership Test Operations Membership test operations are blocks that check a value in the block's parameters against the content in the payload and return a boolean value depending on if the value is present. Again, a boolean is a binary variable, having two possible values called true and false . They check to see if the parameter is a member of the payload. These blocks only function in Tags. Membership Test Operations In {in(string):string} Checks the payload for the presence of the parameter in the payload. Returns true if found or false if not. Contains {contains(element):list} Checks the payload for the presence of the parameter as an element of the payload delimited by spaces. Returns true if found or false if not. The in block is the more powerful of the two, as it checks the payload as a string for the parameter string. Contains is useful to check a list for an element, but is bound to checking for only one element and will return false if that exact element is not present. Example - Membership Test Operations In {in(spam):Most server rules prohibit spamming.} would return true {in(spicy italian):Today Carl had a spicy italian sub.} would return true {in(kable):Kable is awesome} would return false because everything in Tagscript is case-sensitive. Contains {contains(violet):blue black green grey violet red yellow} would return true {contains(maple):pine fir aspen oak dogwood} would return false Membership Test Operations Because these blocks return a boolean value, in almost all use cases it is necessary to check their value, by using them inside Control blocks as one side of a boolean equation. A common use for the contains block is to check if a user has a role. {if({contains(514905279188434972):{user(roleids)}}==true):That's user has the Fake Canadian role!} Embed Blocks Embed blocks change specific values in a tag's attached embed builder (accessible from Carl-bot's Dashboard ). There are only embed blocks for 1st level JSON attributes which are specified as the block's parameters. Embed Blocks Title {embed(title):string} Sets the embed's title to the payload. URL {embed(URL):https://carl.gg} Sets the embed title's URL to the payload. The payload for the URL parameter must be an HTTP formatted URL (begins with http:// or https://) Description {embed(description):string} Sets the embed's description to the payload. Color {embed(color):#5989ab} Sets the color of the embed's left vertical bar to the hexidecimal value in the payload. The payload for the color parameter must have a # preceding the hexidecimal color code. Timestamp {embed(timestamp):now} Sets the embed's timestamp to the value in the payload. now is the only valid payload value for the timestamp parameter. Embed Block Usage A tag's attached embed builder MUST contain some content set via the dashboard before an embed block will \"work\" to modify values in it. Tags created by command line alone will not display an embed even if these embed blocks are present. Manipulation Blocks These are blocks that manipulate the string in the payload in specific ways to return different desired results. They can be used to concatenate a string onto the end of a search URL with the correct encoding for spaces, or to sanitize inputs before using the input in a conditional statement, or to remove spaces or specific characters from the payload. Ordinal Abbreviation Blocks Ord Blocks {ord:number} Returns the number in the payload with the correct Ordinal Abbreviation following it. Example - Ord Blocks {ord:101} returns 101st {ord:22} returns 22nd {ord:3} returns 3rd {ord:456} returns 456th Case Blocks Case blocks change the case of the text in the payload. These blocks only function in Tags. Case Blocks Lower {lower:string} Returns the payload in all lowercase. Upper {upper:string} Returns the payload in all uppercase. These blocks are useful in sanitizing input when checking it against a list that is all one case. Example - Case Blocks Lower {lower:Whoozard is a Wizard} would return whoozard is a wizard Upper {upper:carl-bot best bot} would return CARL-BOT BEST BOT Text Replacement Blocks Text Replacement Blocks blocks involve replacing specific characters or substrings in the payload with other characters or substrings specified in the block's parameters. These blocks only function in Tags. Text Replacement Blocks Join {join(string):string} Replaces every space in the payload with the parameters. Parameters must be set for these blocks, even if they are null. Cannot use the symbols ) or } as parameters. Replace {replace(1st string,2nd string):string} Replaces every instance of the 1st string in the payload with 2nd string. Parameters must be set for these blocks, even if they are null. If the 2nd parameter value for the replace block is null, the block will return the payload with every instance of the 1st parameter value removed. If the 1st parameter value for the replace block is null, the block will return the payload with the 2nd parameter value on each side of every character in the payload. Cannot use the symbol , as the first parameter, nor just the symbols ) or } as any parameters. URLencode The urlencode block encodes the payload into Percent-encoding so it can be included in a URL and understood by the browser of the user that clicked the link. {urlencode:payload} Encodes the payload into percent-encoding. {urlencode(+):payload} Encodes the payload into percent-encoding, but replaces spaces with + instead of %20 Example - Text Replacement Blocks Join {join(_):hello friends} will result in hello_friends {join():an example sentence} will result in anexamplesentence Replace {replace(oo,ee):Goose Tooth Moose} will result in Geese Teeth Meese /{replace(, ):Carl-Bot}/ will result in / C a r l - B o t / URLencode {urlencode:Hey there, how are you?} will return Hey%20there%2C%20how%20are%20you%3F {urlencode(+):Hey there, how are you?} will return Hey+there%2C+how+are+you%3F https://www.google.com/search?q={urlencode(+):Carl-bot's dashboard} will result in this link: Google Search Results Math Blocks Math blocks perform the mathematical operations in the payload and return the results. Math Block Aliases {math:8+9} {calc:7-4} {+:8/2} {m:5*6} Evaluates the mathematical operations in the payload in the correct order of operations and returns the result. Block names are synonymous. Supported Mathematical Operations, Functions and Variables Basic a+b Addition a-b Subtraction a*b Multiplication a/b Division a%b Modulo a^b Exponent abs(x) Absolute value of x round(x) Rounds x to the nearest whole number trunc(x) Truncates x to integer value (chops off decimals) Advanced sin(x) Returns the sine of x radians cos(x) Returns the cosine of x radians tan(x) Returns the tangent of x radians exp(x) Returns Euler's number raised to the power of x sgn(x) Returns the Sign of x. For x>0 returns 1, for x=0 returns 0, for x<0 returns -1. log(x) Returns the logarithm of x (base 10) ln(x) Returns the natural logarithm of x (base e) log2(x) Returns the logarithm of x (base 2) pi or PI can be used to indicate \ud835\udf0b (3.141592653589793) e or E can be used to indicate Euler's Number (2.718281828459045) Examples - Math Blocks {math:cos(pi)} would return -1.0 {m:round(7.8)+trunc(8.9)} would return 16 RNG Blocks Sometimes you want some random in your tag. These blocks have the Tagscript Engine pick a random value out of a list or range you provide. Random Blocks Random blocks choose a random value from the payload. Random Block Aliases {random(optional_seed):List,of,elements} {rand(optional_seed):List~of~elements} {#(optional_seed):4|Weighted,2|list,of,3|elements} Chooses a random value out of the list in the payload. Block names are synonymous. You can use , to separate simple lists, but if you want to use commas as part of an element, you must instead use ~ to separate all the elements. Element Weighting Elements in the payload can be weighted if that is desired. Weighting a value is the same as if that value was in the list of elements that many times. {random:4|a,2|b} is the same as {random:a,a,a,a,b,b} Example - Random Blocks {rand:Hello, how are you?~Howdy} will return either Hello, how are you? or Howdy {#({args}):1,2,3} {#({args}):one,two,three} will always return elements with matching indices. 1 one , 2 two , or 3 three {random:99|You lost,You won!} has a 1% chance of returning You won! Seed values Seed values are optional. When a seed value is included as a random block's parameter, the block will 'lock' the random choice to the same index value of the payload every time that same seed value is used. This works similar to a cycle block; the seed value might lock to an index value larger than the number of elements in the list and cycle around. Thus, seed_index % list_length might result in different index values being chosen should the same seed be used in random blocks with different list lengths. If you want tag users to receive the same random value each time they use the tag, a common method of doing so is setting the seed value to one of the {user} objects immutable properties, like {user(id)} or {user(created_at)} . Range Blocks Range blocks return a random number in the range of numbers in the payload. Range Block {range(optional_seed):Lower#-Higher#} Returns a random whole number in the specified range {rangef(optional_seed):Lower#-Higher#} Returns a random number in the specified range with tenths place decimal numbers. The number range is inclusive, meaning it can pick either endpoint of the specified range as well. It can be seeded similar to the Random block. Rangef will multiply both range endpoints by 10, get a random number in that range, and divide it by 10 to return a number with a tenths place decimal value. Example - Range Blocks {range:1-100} would pick a number from 1 to 100, like 19 {rangef:8-9} would pick a number from 8.0 to 9.0, like 8.7 50/50 Blocks 50/50 Block Aliases {5050:payload} {50:payload} {?:payload} Has a 50% chance of returning the payload, and a 50% chance of being null. Block names are synonymous. Time Blocks Time blocks deal with time and how it is represented, as well as calculating the duration between two dates. All time blocks use and display time values for Coordinated Universal Time (or UTC). DateTime Format Within this section whenever \"DateTime\" is mentioned, it means a date and time in the following format: yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS Currently triggers, welcome messages, and autofeeds use periods . where the colons : are: yyyy-mm-dd HH.MM.SS Strf Blocks Strf blocks return the time data formatted according to Python's strftime, see http://strftime.org/ or the Linux Programmer's Manual for more information. Strf Blocks {strf(optional DateTime or Unix time):strf formatting codes} Returns the DateTime value listed in the parameters in the format described in the payload. If no parameters are provided, the Tagscript Engine defaults to using the current DateTime as the implied parameters. Example - Strf Blocks December 31st 1999 was a {strf(1999-12-31 23.59.59):%A} will output December 31st 1999 was a Friday The current time is {strf:%-I:%M %p} will output The current time is followed by whatever the current 12h clock is for UTC, like 2:19 AM Your account was created on {strf({user(created_at)}: %x} will output Your account was created on 2015/12/24 (for me at least) Strf Formats for Reference %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S & the short version %F %T are the DateTime format in strf codes, which can be useful for defining the payload of the timedelta block described below. {strf:%%FT%T}.000Z is the strf code for the ISO 8601 format, which is used when setting the timestamp in an embed's JSON. Useful if you're using Carl-bot's cembed or ecembed commands in a tag. %s Lowercase s is the code for Unix time. Since the {unix} block only works in tags, this code is useful to set to a variable named unix when doing time-based math in welcome messages, triggers, and autofeeds. Timedelta Blocks Timedelta blocks calculate the delta, or difference, between two time values. Timedelta Blocks {td(optional DateTime or Unix time):DateTime value} Outputs a string describing the difference in time between the parameters and the payload. If no parameters are provided, the Tagscript Engine defaults to using the current DateTime as the implied parameters. Example - Timedelta Blocks {td:2020-01-01 00.00.00} as of 2019-11-25 would output 1 month, 5 days and 21 hours , or the time until Midnight New Years Day {td({m:trunc({unix}-3600)}):{strf:%Y-%m-%d %H.%M.%S}} will always output 1 hour because {unix} is the current time and we subtracted 3600 seconds. Going from Blocks to Tags Most programming language guides start you off with a \"Hello World\" tutorial, but considering Tags output plaintext as a message, we'll have to change it up. Let's start with a \"Hello _____\" tag that will say hello to whomever the tag's user mentions. At the end of this tutorial we'll have the tag give the mentioned user a role, so let's call this tag \"verify\". verify's Content: 1 Hello {target(mention)} Pretty simple right? But if someone only says !hello with no text following, it will say \"Hello\" to the user, which is not our intention. We should add a check to see if the tag user mentioned someone else, and if they didn't, we'll instruct them to. To check if another user was mentioned, form a boolean equation with {user(id)} on one side, either equals ( == ) or not-equals ( != ) in the middle, and {target(id)} on the other side. If the user mentioned someone, the target's ID will be different, and if they didn't mention someone or mentioned themselves, the target's ID will be equal to the user's ID. To form the else statement, follow the first payload with a vertical bar ( | ). verify's Content: 1 {if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):Hello {target(mention)}|You need to mention someone.} It's a start, but let's make it fancier. Why don't we put the output into an embed? Best practice is to either set Tagscript sections to variables and call the variables in the embed builder, or to use embed blocks in the content section. I'll show how to do both, to familiarize you with variable assignment. We'll set our message to desc and add a little something to our hello statement as well, and we'll set our error message to the variable error . We'll reference those variables in the payload of our existing control block, and put the control block as the payload of our embed description block. verify's Content: 1 2 3 {=(desc):Hello {target(mention)}, welcome to {server}!} {=(error):You need to mention someone.} {embed(description):{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):{desc}|{error}}} Then we'll add {server(icon)} to the embed builder as the thumbnail URL to allow the embed block to work. Embed Block Usage Remember, a tag's attached embed builder MUST contain some content set via the dashboard before an embed block will \"work\" to modify values in it. Tags created by command line alone will not display an embed even if these embed blocks are present. Now let's give the embed a color! We'll use the mentioned target's color to personalize the embed to them. Add {embed(color):{target(color)}} to the tag's content section. verify's Content: 1 2 3 4 {=(desc):Hello {target(mention)}, welcome to {server}!} {=(error):You need to mention someone.} {embed(description):{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):{desc}|{error}}} {embed(color):{target(color)}} But what if the target is a new user and does not have a color yet? Let's create a random hexidecimal color code and use that if the target does not have a color. To create a random hexidecimal color, we'll need to utilize 6 random blocks each with the set of all hexidecimal character values. Let's set the values to a variable named hex we'll call later to save space. {=(hex):0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F} We'll also set our color (the 6 random blocks) to a variable for later use. We'll use the # alias for the random blocks. {=(rand.color):#{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}} Now we can update our embed(color) block with an if statement. The default Discord color is #000000, so we'll check if that is the target's color, and if it is we'll use {random.color} , and if not we'll use the target's color. Our tag now looks like this: verify's Content: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 {=(desc):Hello {target(mention)}, welcome to {server}!} {=(error):You need to mention someone.} {embed(description):{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):{desc}|{error}}} {embed(color):{target(color)}} {=(hex):0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F} {=(rand.color):#{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}} {embed(color):{if({target(color)}==#000000):{rand.color}|{target(color)}}} Lastly, let's assign a role (that already exists) to the mentioned target to show that we have verified them using a command block, but only when a target is mentioned. We're going to utilize a clever trick to conditionally make the command block only exist when a target is mentioned. We will create a variable with no name and no content, and put the innards of the command block into a control block's payload, then put brackets around that control block. If the boolean equation in the control block is true and the control block returns the payload (our command block's innards), the brackets surrounding it will make that payload a functional command block. If the boolean equation in the control block is false, the brackets surrouding the control block will have nothing inside of them, and will form a variable call block for our \"empty\" variable and return the content in that variable, which is nothing. Our special variable will be: {=():} Our command block innards are: cmd:role add {target(id)} Verified Our control block is: {if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):} ( same as the one we used before ) Putting the command block innards into the control block and adding an extra pair of brackets around it will result in this: 1 2 {=():} {{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):cmd:role add {target(id)} Verified}} Let's combine everything and look at our final tag! verify's Content: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 {=(desc):Hello {target(mention)}, welcome to {server}!} {=(error):You need to mention someone.} {embed(description):{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):{desc}|{error}}} {embed(color):{target(color)}} {=(hex):0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F} {=(rand.color):#{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}} {embed(color):{if({target(color)}==#000000):{rand.color}|{target(color)}}} {=():} {{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):cmd:role add {target(id)} Verified}} What your verify tag's output might look like: Reminder You can add {silent} and {delete} anywhere in the tag if you do not want to see the output of the command block or want the tag's invocation automatically deleted. Important Note on Block Behavior Blocks can be placed and nested inside any parts of other blocks to change or modify their behavior. However, all complete, properly formatted blocks \"execute\". What does that mean? As an example, let's say you want to give a user the Verified role if they supply a passphrase. Many readers with some experience using other programming languages would type something like, Example of what NOT TO DO {if({args}=={passphrase}):{cmd:role add {user} Verified}} However, that command block is a complete, properly formatted block. Tagscript does not care that it is the payload of a control block. The command block will execute, and give the user the role even if the control block's parameters are false. This is not a bug, this is intentional and due to how the Tagscript interpreter works. This applies to all blocks. Because we cannot use conditional statements outside complete blocks to negate complete blocks from executing, we must use control blocks inside complete blocks to determine what the contents of the complete blocks are. Because the control block must be inside the complete block, it creates a small issue. What part of the previous command block should we use as the if block's payload, and how do we avoid the bot complaining when the boolean equation in the if block is incorrect. Here are some of the different correct options available: Correct ways to conditionally run a command {cmd:{if({args}=={passphrase}):role add {user} Verified|echo That is not the passphrase}} This passes the echo command to the command block if the boolean equation is incorrect, so the command block is not empty. {cmd:role add {user} {if({args}=={passphrase}):Verified|UnVerified}} This adds an alternate role the command grants if the boolean equation is incorrect, so the role add command is not incomplete. {=():}{{if({args}=={passphrase}):cmd:role add {user} Verified}} This defines an empty variable with no name or payload, and double brackets the entire if statement. Depending on the output of the boolean equation, it will either result in {cmd:role add {user} Verified} or {} . The empty variable makes sure if the boolean equation is incorrect, the tag does not output a pair of empty brackets {} . Another common goal is to conditionally set variables to a value or to create multiple variables that act as data tables that return information according to a given key. Let's explore how to do that correctly in Tagscript: Example of what NOT TO DO {if({args}==xmas):{assign(name):Christmas}{assign(date):-12-25}{assign(emoji):\ud83c\udf84}} {if({args}==vday):{assign(name):Valentine's Day}{assign(date):-02-14}{assign(emoji):\u2764\ufe0f}} This is similar to the example above. Because those variable assignment blocks are complete, properly formatted blocks, Tagscript executes them and assigns the values in their payloads to the variable names in the blocks' parameters. Since the vday assignment line comes after the xmas one, no matter what {args} is, {name} will be Valentine's Day , {date} will be -02-14 , and {emoji} will be \u2764\ufe0f . Again, we must move our control blocks inside our complete blocks. Technically correct but inefficient {assign(name):{if({args}==xmas):Christmas|{if({args}==vday):Valentine's Day}}} {assign(date):{if({args}==xmas):-12-25|{if({args}==vday):-02-14}}} {assign(emoji):{if({args}==xmas):\ud83c\udf84|{if({args}==vday):\u2764\ufe0f}}} Holiday: {name} Date: {date} Emoji: {emoji} While this is correct, it's long, and not really the best way to do this. Think about the data and how it could be better collected. A correct way to conditionally assign variables {assign(xmas):Christmas|-12-25|\ud83c\udf84} {assign(vday):Valentine's Day|-02-14|\u2764\ufe0f} {any({args}==xmas|{args}==vday): Holiday: {{args}(1):|} Date: {{args}(2):|} Emoji: {{args}(3):|}} This method assigns all the data that is related to the same holiday to variables split by a pipe symbol, then references each by doublebracketing args when args matches either variable's name.","title":"Tags - Advanced Usage"},{"location":"tags-and-triggers/tags-advanced-usage/#tags-advanced-usage","text":"Tags are custom commands. They are easy to use and can be very powerful. With some ingenuity, you can create your own. It is for instance entirely possible to create an 8ball command, a hug command and many other things using just tags. To do more than just output plaintext, you must configure the command's behavior using what is called Tagscript. Tagscript is a small language the bot interprets, made up of dynamic \"blocks\". To build a tag you will need to combine various blocks to tell the tag what you want it to do. Some parts of Tagscript can be used elsewhere within Carl-bot, like in Triggers, Autofeeds, and Welcome/Leave/Ban Messages. Limits Tags must be under 25000 characters long in the \"Content\" section. Tags CANNOT and will NEVER be able to DM a mentioned user, only the tag's invoker.

They are conditional statements that evaluate boolean equations you provide as block parameters. Booleans A boolean is a binary variable, having two possible values called true and false . Boolean equations compare an entity on the left of an operator to an entity to the right of the operator, and depending on the comparison the operator requires, it evaluates to either true or false. Boolean Operators in Tagscript Equal == Evaluates to true if the string on the left is identical to the string on the right. Not Equal != Evaluates to true if the string on the left is not identical to the string on the right. Greater Than > and >= Evaluates to true if the number on the left side is greater than the number on the right. >= is greater than or equal. Less Than < and <= Evaluates to true if the number on the left side is less than the number on the right. <= is less than or equal. Examples - Boolean Equations Equal cat==dog This would evaluate to false. 5==5 This would evaluate to true. Not Equal tree!=car This would evaluate to true. 10!=10 This would evaluate to false. Greater Than 15>20 This would evaluate to false. 17>=17 This would evaluate to true. Less Than 1<=1 This would evaluate to true. 25<5 This would evaluate to false. If the boolean equation in the block's parameters evaluates as true, the control block will continue executing the payload. If the boolean equation evaluates as false, the control block will execute the second portion of the payload starting after the | character, if present, otherwise the tag will act as if the control block does not exist.

All/And {all(booleanEQ1|booleanEQ2|etc):then|else} {and(booleanEQ1|booleanEQ2|etc):then|else} If all of the boolean equations provided evaluate to true, the block will result in the payload.

Break/Shortcircuit {shortcircuit(booleanEQ):then} {short(booleanEQ):then} {break(booleanEQ):then} If the boolean equation evaluates to true, the tag's output will ONLY be the payload of this block. However, Carl-bot commands in command blocks will still execute, and if an embed is defined in the tag's attached embed builder it will still send. Else Statements For the if , any , and all control blocks, an optional else statement can be added after the payload by using a pipe character | . If the boolean equation is true the payload is what is between the colon : and the pipe | . If the boolean equation is false, the payload is what is between the pipe | and the end of the block } .

The elements in a list are indexed according to their sequence. Index values for variables start at 1 and increment with each delimiter encountered. A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters for specifying the boundary between separate, independent strings. The default delimiter for variables in Tagscript is a space. You can also set a custom delimiter for a variable block by specifying it as the variable block's payload. Example - Variable Parsing {args} is the most common variable used in tags, because it is how a tag's creator accesses the information included with the tag's invocation. In this example, {args} is: Carl likes Subway. Today he got a Spicy Italian with - double pepperoni, double salami, provolone, and tomatoes. Basic Parsing Since space is the default delimiter, you can easily grab individual words {args(1)}==Carl , {args(2)}==likes , and {args(3)}==Subway.

Thus, seed_index % list_length might result in different index values being chosen should the same seed be used in random blocks with different list lengths.

Let's start with a \"Hello _____\" tag that will say hello to whomever the tag's user mentions. At the end of this tutorial we'll have the tag give the mentioned user a role, so let's call this tag \"verify\". verify's Content: 1 Hello {target(mention)} Pretty simple right? But if someone only says !hello with no text following, it will say \"Hello\" to the user, which is not our intention. We should add a check to see if the tag user mentioned someone else, and if they didn't, we'll instruct them to. To check if another user was mentioned, form a boolean equation with {user(id)} on one side, either equals ( == ) or not-equals ( != ) in the middle, and {target(id)} on the other side. If the user mentioned someone, the target's ID will be different, and if they didn't mention someone or mentioned themselves, the target's ID will be equal to the user's ID. To form the else statement, follow the first payload with a vertical bar ( | ). verify's Content: 1 {if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):Hello {target(mention)}|You need to mention someone.} It's a start, but let's make it fancier. Why don't we put the output into an embed? Best practice is to either set Tagscript sections to variables and call the variables in the embed builder, or to use embed blocks in the content section. I'll show how to do both, to familiarize you with variable assignment. We'll set our message to desc and add a little something to our hello statement as well, and we'll set our error message to the variable error . We'll reference those variables in the payload of our existing control block, and put the control block as the payload of our embed description block. verify's Content: 1 2 3 {=(desc):Hello {target(mention)}, welcome to {server}!} {=(error):You need to mention someone.} {embed(description):{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):{desc}|{error}}} Then we'll add {server(icon)} to the embed builder as the thumbnail URL to allow the embed block to work. Embed Block Usage Remember, a tag's attached embed builder MUST contain some content set via the dashboard before an embed block will \"work\" to modify values in it. Tags created by command line alone will not display an embed even if these embed blocks are present. Now let's give the embed a color! We'll use the mentioned target's color to personalize the embed to them. Add {embed(color):{target(color)}} to the tag's content section. verify's Content: 1 2 3 4 {=(desc):Hello {target(mention)}, welcome to {server}!} {=(error):You need to mention someone.} {embed(description):{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):{desc}|{error}}} {embed(color):{target(color)}} But what if the target is a new user and does not have a color yet? Let's create a random hexidecimal color code and use that if the target does not have a color. To create a random hexidecimal color, we'll need to utilize 6 random blocks each with the set of all hexidecimal character values. Let's set the values to a variable named hex we'll call later to save space. {=(hex):0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F} We'll also set our color (the 6 random blocks) to a variable for later use. We'll use the # alias for the random blocks. {=(rand.color):#{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}} Now we can update our embed(color) block with an if statement. The default Discord color is #000000, so we'll check if that is the target's color, and if it is we'll use {random.color} , and if not we'll use the target's color. Our tag now looks like this: verify's Content: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 {=(desc):Hello {target(mention)}, welcome to {server}!} {=(error):You need to mention someone.} {embed(description):{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):{desc}|{error}}} {embed(color):{target(color)}} {=(hex):0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F} {=(rand.color):#{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}} {embed(color):{if({target(color)}==#000000):{rand.color}|{target(color)}}} Lastly, let's assign a role (that already exists) to the mentioned target to show that we have verified them using a command block, but only when a target is mentioned. We're going to utilize a clever trick to conditionally make the command block only exist when a target is mentioned. We will create a variable with no name and no content, and put the innards of the command block into a control block's payload, then put brackets around that control block. If the boolean equation in the control block is true and the control block returns the payload (our command block's innards), the brackets surrounding it will make that payload a functional command block. If the boolean equation in the control block is false, the brackets surrouding the control block will have nothing inside of them, and will form a variable call block for our \"empty\" variable and return the content in that variable, which is nothing. Our special variable will be: {=():} Our command block innards are: cmd:role add {target(id)} Verified Our control block is: {if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):} ( same as the one we used before ) Putting the command block innards into the control block and adding an extra pair of brackets around it will result in this: 1 2 {=():} {{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):cmd:role add {target(id)} Verified}} Let's combine everything and look at our final tag! verify's Content: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 {=(desc):Hello {target(mention)}, welcome to {server}!} {=(error):You need to mention someone.} {embed(description):{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):{desc}|{error}}} {embed(color):{target(color)}} {=(hex):0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F} {=(rand.color):#{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}{#:{hex}}} {embed(color):{if({target(color)}==#000000):{rand.color}|{target(color)}}} {=():} {{if({user(id)}!={target(id)}):cmd:role add {target(id)} Verified}} What your verify tag's output might look like: Reminder You can add {silent} and {delete} anywhere in the tag if you do not want to see the output of the command block or want the tag's invocation automatically deleted.","title":"Going from Blocks to Tags"},{"location":"tags-and-triggers/tags-advanced-usage/#important-note-on-block-behavior","text":"Blocks can be placed and nested inside any parts of other blocks to change or modify their behavior. However, all complete, properly formatted blocks \"execute\". What does that mean? As an example, let's say you want to give a user the Verified role if they supply a passphrase. Many readers with some experience using other programming languages would type something like, Example of what NOT TO DO {if({args}=={passphrase}):{cmd:role add {user} Verified}} However, that command block is a complete, properly formatted block. Tagscript does not care that it is the payload of a control block. The command block will execute, and give the user the role even if the control block's parameters are false. This is not a bug, this is intentional and due to how the Tagscript interpreter works. This applies to all blocks. Because we cannot use conditional statements outside complete blocks to negate complete blocks from executing, we must use control blocks inside complete blocks to determine what the contents of the complete blocks are. Because the control block must be inside the complete block, it creates a small issue. What part of the previous command block should we use as the if block's payload, and how do we avoid the bot complaining when the boolean equation in the if block is incorrect. Here are some of the different correct options available: Correct ways to conditionally run a command {cmd:{if({args}=={passphrase}):role add {user} Verified|echo That is not the passphrase}} This passes the echo command to the command block if the boolean equation is incorrect, so the command block is not empty. {cmd:role add {user} {if({args}=={passphrase}):Verified|UnVerified}} This adds an alternate role the command grants if the boolean equation is incorrect, so the role add command is not incomplete. {=():}{{if({args}=={passphrase}):cmd:role add {user} Verified}} This defines an empty variable with no name or payload, and double brackets the entire if statement. Depending on the output of the boolean equation, it will either result in {cmd:role add {user} Verified} or {} . The empty variable makes sure if the boolean equation is incorrect, the tag does not output a pair of empty brackets {} . Another common goal is to conditionally set variables to a value or to create multiple variables that act as data tables that return information according to a given key. Let's explore how to do that correctly in Tagscript: Example of what NOT TO DO {if({args}==xmas):{assign(name):Christmas}{assign(date):-12-25}{assign(emoji):\ud83c\udf84}} {if({args}==vday):{assign(name):Valentine's Day}{assign(date):-02-14}{assign(emoji):\u2764\ufe0f}} This is similar to the example above. Because those variable assignment blocks are complete, properly formatted blocks, Tagscript executes them and assigns the values in their payloads to the variable names in the blocks' parameters. Since the vday assignment line comes after the xmas one, no matter what {args} is, {name} will be Valentine's Day , {date} will be -02-14 , and {emoji} will be \u2764\ufe0f . Again, we must move our control blocks inside our complete blocks. Technically correct but inefficient {assign(name):{if({args}==xmas):Christmas|{if({args}==vday):Valentine's Day}}} {assign(date):{if({args}==xmas):-12-25|{if({args}==vday):-02-14}}} {assign(emoji):{if({args}==xmas):\ud83c\udf84|{if({args}==vday):\u2764\ufe0f}}} Holiday: {name} Date: {date} Emoji: {emoji} While this is correct, it's long, and not really the best way to do this. Think about the data and how it could be better collected. A correct way to conditionally assign variables {assign(xmas):Christmas|-12-25|\ud83c\udf84} {assign(vday):Valentine's Day|-02-14|\u2764\ufe0f} {any({args}==xmas|{args}==vday): Holiday: {{args}(1):|} Date: {{args}(2):|} Emoji: {{args}(3):|}} This method assigns all the data that is related to the same holiday to variables split by a pipe symbol, then references each by doublebracketing args when args matches either variable's name.","title":"Important Note on Block Behavior"},{"location":"tags-and-triggers/triggers/","text":"Triggers Warning Autoresponses are not custom commands, if you want things that are triggered by a prefix and a keyword, see the tag section.
