### Setup

!!! tip
	Anyone can use the `report` command, and by default Carl-bot will delete the command invocation when used. Instruct your users to use it in the channel where the event they're reporting happened, so your staff can make use of the jump link the report generates.

### Server/Channel Lockdown

!!! warning
    Locking down a channel denies the @everyone role `send messages` as an override in the specified channel. Any roles explicitly granting send messages will override this for anyone with that role. Locking down the server removes send messages from the @everyone role. You set up your server correctly by removing send messages from all non-mod roles.

	| :--- | :--- | :--- |
	| **lockdown &lt;\#channel&gt; &lt;duration&gt;** | !lockdown \#general 20m | Locks the specified channel (or the one the command is used in if none is specified) for [duration] if specified else forever. |
	| **unlockdown &lt;\#channel&gt;** | !unlockdown \#general |  Undoes what !lockdown does. |
	| **lockdown server &lt;duration&gt;** | !lockdown server 20m | Locks all channels in the server. |
	| **unlockdown server** | !unlockdown server |  Undoes what !lockdown server does. |
