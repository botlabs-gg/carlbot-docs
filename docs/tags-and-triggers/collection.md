# Collection of high quality tags

On this page some of the more clever and technical tags will be showcased.

Want your creation featured here? Post it in #show off in [the support server](https://carl.gg/discord) and be a little lucky. I value creativity and novel solutions more than advanced tagscript usage.

## Utility tags

!!! info "!report - A way to report misbehavior by The Chain Warden#8790"

    [https://carl.gg/t/60262](https://carl.gg/t/60262)

    _A fail-proof report tag that will DM the user a copy their report, aswell as send it to the designated reports channel. If the user fails to fill the report correctly (by not mentioning a valid target, aswell as not giving some info), s/he'll get a DM informing that the report failed, with the reason for it, and will not post it to the reports channel. To remove the need to mention someone for the command to work, set {=(forcemention):1} to {=(forcemention):0}. Remember to change the value of {chanid} to the reports' channel ID.
