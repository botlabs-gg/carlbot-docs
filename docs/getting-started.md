 ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
`<foo>`           | This argument is mandatory                                                                        
`<foos...>`       | This argument is mandatory and you can specify more than one                                      
`[foo]`           | This argument is optional                                                                         
`[foo='muted']`   | This argument is optional and will use the default value **muted** if not specified               
`[foo\|bar]`      | This argument is optional so you can either use **foo** or **bar**, or don't specify it at all    
`[foos...]`       | This argument is optional and you can specify more than one                                       

Additionally, the bot uses *converters* which makes specifying roles, members, channels etc, easy and fool-proof. When asked to specify a member, you can provide it a mention, an id, a name or a nickname. This principle works for every single command where applicable.


## Basic Configuration
?> Use the **[Dashboard](https://carl.gg)** to configure the bot easily without the need to use any commands.

!["Bot Settings"](_images/bot_settings.png ':size=75%')

This guide will cover everything you need to do to get started with the basics of what carlbot offers.


+ ### Prefix
By default, Carl-bot responds to `!` and `?` prefixes as well as `/` slash commands. To make the bot respond to another prefix, `-` for example, you can use `!prefix set -`.
To add a prefix without removing the others, use `!prefix add -`. Carl-bot can have upto **15 prefixes** in each server.


+ ### Channels
    - **Log Channel**: `!log channel <#channel>` sets the channel where Carl-bot will log things such as message deletions, name changes, role updates and a lot more which you can find later on in this documentation.
    - **Welcome/Leave Channel**: `!set welcome <#channel>` sets the channel where join/leave/banmessage alerts will go. More on that later.


+ ### Reaction Roles
Reaction roles work best in their own channels, so Carl-bot offers a command to create a channel specifically for reaction roles with some permissions that most users will find useful. You can create this channel using `!rr channel`. If you are new, it is recommended to use `!rr make` instead.


+ ### Modlogs
To create a channel where you can see the logs of all moderation actions taken in your server, you can use `!modlogs create`. This will create the modlogs channel with appropriate permissions. But if you already have a channel ready for this purpose then you can use `!modlogs set <#channel>` instead.


+ ### Starboard
To create a starboard use `!starboard`. To change the limit of stars required for a post to show up in the starboard use `!star limit <count>`.


+ ### Logs
By default, Carl-bot will log everything every member does in every channel. This isn't always what you want so let's say that you don't care about message edits. You can use `!log edit` to stop those from showing up in the logs.
The `!log` command takes an event as its argument and tries to figure out what you want toggled. Another thing you can do is ignore logs only in certain channels. For that you can use `!log ignore <#channel>` to ignore all events from that channel. Logs are very customizable so make sure to head over that section for full information.


+ ### Mute Role
By using `!muterole create` you can create a role with the permission <span style="color: red;">Send Messages</span> denied in every channel. Users can now be muted using `!mute <@member> [time] [reason]`.

!> Any future channels created will not be covered by Mute Role.


+ ### Welcome Message
You can set the welcome message that would be sent in the previously set [channel](#channels) using `!welcome <message>`. You can also set a different message to be sent in a DM to the member upon joining by using `!joindm <message>`. There are a few variables that can be used in these commands which you can read about in later sections, such as `{user}` for mentioning the user to whom the message is addressed to.

This is far from everything Carl-bot has to offer but at this point you will have set up the crucial things that you can set up.


## FAQ

### How do I get the Message ID? {docsify-ignore}
**Right Click** the message and select **Copy ID**

?> To enable this option you would need to do the following:<br>
Discord Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode > Enable

![Discord ID](_images/faq_discordid.png ':size=75%')


### Another bot has the same command and they both respond, what do I do? {docsify-ignore}
Depends on what you're after. If you need to use both, you're pretty much forced to change the prefix of either bot. If you just want the command that is not from Carl-bot then you can disable it with `!disable <command>`. If you just want Carl-bot's command then you may create an alias using tags and `{cmd:cmdname {args}}`. Check out the Advanced Usage section in Tags category for more information.


### Why does the bot complain about requiring more permissions? I've given it <span style="color: red;">Manage Roles</span> already. {docsify-ignore}
The way Discord decides if you can add a role or not is based on two things:
* Does the Member adding the role have <span style="color: red;">Manage Roles</span> permission?
* Is the member trying to add a role higher in the role hierarchy than the bot's role?

Just assign the bot a role that is higher than the highest role it has to assign. The role being hoisted does not have to have any special permissions.


### What is the drama channel? {docsify-ignore}
This is a [Premium](https://www.patreon.com/carlbot) feature that aims to streamline your server's moderation. Automod is nice but it is not perfect as sometimes false positives happen. This feature was made for that exact reason. You need to:
1. Set up the drama channel on either the Dashboard or with the command `!am drama <channel>`.
2. Set the automod punishment to `Post to drama channel` on the Dashboard.
